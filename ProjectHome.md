httperf is a tool for measuring web server performance. It provides a flexible facility for generating various HTTP workloads and for measuring server performance.

The focus of httperf is not on implementing one particular benchmark but on providing a robust, high-performance tool that facilitates the construction of both micro- and macro-level benchmarks. The three distinguishing characteristics of httperf are its robustness, which includes the ability to generate and sustain server overload, support for the HTTP/1.1 and SSL protocols, and its extensibility to new workload generators and performance measurements.

Figured out my lost account to access the httperf repository. Although I am not currently doing active development for httperf, you can now submit bug reports and I will be able to receive them.

NOTE, all users are encouraged to use the version from subversion as it should actually be more stable, and has a couple delicious new features.
